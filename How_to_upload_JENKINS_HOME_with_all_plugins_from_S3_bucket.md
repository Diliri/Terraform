To upload the **JENKINS_HOME** directory along with all plugins from an Amazon S3 bucket,  
you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to copy the data. Here's a basic outline of the steps:

1.    __Install AWS CLI:__
    If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI, you can do so by following the instructions in the [official AWS CLI documentation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

2.    __Configure AWS CLI:__
    Configure the AWS CLI with the necessary credentials and region using the aws configure command.  
```bash
aws configure
```
4.    __Copy JENKINS_HOME to S3 Bucket:__
Use the **aws s3 cp** command to copy the entire **JENKINS_HOME** directory to your S3 bucket.  

```bash
aws s3 cp /path/to/JENKINS_HOME s3://your-s3-bucket/JENKINS_HOME --recursive
```

Replace **/path/to/JENKINS_HOME** with the actual path to your **JENKINS_HOME** directory and **your-s3-bucket** with the name of your S3 bucket.

4.    __Copy Jenkins Plugins:__
To copy Jenkins plugins, navigate to the JENKINS_HOME/plugins directory and copy its contents to the S3 bucket.  

```bash
aws s3 cp /path/to/JENKINS_HOME/plugins s3://your-s3-bucket/plugins --recursive
```
Replace **/path/to/JENKINS_HOME/plugins** with the actual path to your Jenkins plugins directory.

5.    __Download and Restore JENKINS_HOME on Another Server:__
On another Jenkins server where you want to restore the **JENKINS_HOME** from S3, you can use the **aws s3 sync** command to download the contents of the S3 bucket.  

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://your-s3-bucket/JENKINS_HOME /path/to/target/JENKINS_HOME
```

Replace **/path/to/target/JENKINS_HOME** with the desired local path where you want to restore **JENKINS_HOME.**

After downloading **JENKINS_HOME**, you would also want to copy the plugins back to the **JENKINS_HOME/plugins** directory.  

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://your-s3-bucket/plugins /path/to/target/JENKINS_HOME/plugins
```

Please note that this approach assumes you have proper backups and a clear understanding of your Jenkins configuration.  
Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that Jenkins is not running during the backup and restore processes to avoid potential issues.  
Always test the process in a safe environment before attempting it on a production system.
